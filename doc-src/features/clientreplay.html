Client-side replay does what it says on the tin: you provide a previously saved
HTTP conversation, and mitmproxy replays the client requests one by one. Note
that mitmproxy serializes the requests, waiting for a response from the server
before starting the next request. This might differ from the recorded
conversation, where requests may have been made concurrently.

You may want to use client-side replay in conjunction with the
[anticache](@!urlTo("anticache.html")!@) option, to make sure the server
responds with complete data.
