When the __anticache__ option is passed to mitmproxy, it removes headers
(__if-none-match__ and __if-modified-since__) that might elicit a
304-not-modified response from the server. This is useful when you want to make
sure you capture an HTTP exchange in its totality. It's also often used during
[client replay](@!urlTo("clientreplay.html")!@), when you want to make sure the
server responds with complete data.
