WebSockets or other non-HTTP protocols are not supported by mitmproxy yet. However, you can exempt hostnames from
processing, so that mitmproxy acts as a generic TCP forwarder. This feature is closely related to the
[ignore domains](@!urlTo("passthrough.html")!@) functionality, but differs in two important aspects:

- The raw TCP messages are printed to the event log.
- SSL connections will be intercepted.

Please note that message interception or modification are not possible yet.
If you are not interested in the raw TCP messages, you should use the ignore domains feature.

## How it works


<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th width="20%">command-line</th> <td>--tcp HOST</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>mitmproxy shortcut</th> <td><b>T</b></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

For a detailed description on the structure of the hostname pattern, please refer to the [Ignore Domains](@!urlTo("passthrough.html")!@) feature.
