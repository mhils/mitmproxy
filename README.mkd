__mitmproxy__ is an interactive, SSL-capable man-in-the-middle proxy for HTTP
with a console interface.

__mitmdump__ is the command-line version of mitmproxy. Think tcpdump for HTTP.

__libmproxy__ is the library that mitmproxy and mitmdump are built on.

Complete documentation and a set of practical tutorials is included in the

The following auxiliary components may be needed if you plan to hack on
mitmproxy:

* The test suite uses the [nose](http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/) unit testing
  framework and requires [human_curl](https://github.com/Lispython/human_curl) and
  [pathod](http://pathod.org).
* Rendering the documentation requires [countershape](http://github.com/cortesi/countershape).

__mitmproxy__ is tested and developed on OSX, Linux and OpenBSD. Windows is not
supported at the moment.

You should also make sure that your console environment is set up with the
following:

* EDITOR environment variable to determine the external editor.
* PAGER environment variable to determine the external pager.
* Appropriate entries in your mailcap files to determine external
  viewers for request and response contents.
